Getting Started
---------------

In order to start with the project, you need just include the RichFaces JARs on the classpath using Maven dependency

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.richfaces</groupId>
        <artifactId>richfaces</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>

or download the project ZIP distribution from [Downloads Page](http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download.html).

Once you have the RichFaces JARs on the classpath, you can start developing by adding JSF page which includes RichFaces taglib from `http://richfaces.org/rich` namespace:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en"
		xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
		...
		xmlns:r="http://richfaces.org/rich">

	</html>

For more information on how to get started with the project, see [Project Documentation](http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/).

Building the Project
--------------------

Prerequsities:

* JDK 1.6 +
* Maven 3.0.4 +

Building the project:

    $ mvn clean install

Maven will build the project and execute unit tests, but it won't build distribution or execute integration tests.

<h3>Building Project Distribution</h3>

    $ mvn clean install -Prelease

the ZIP distribution will be stored in `dist/target/`.

Developing the Project
----------------------

<h3>How to Test the Project</h3>

RichFaces has extensive framework test suite which validates compatibility with various browsers and application servers.

For more information on how to run and develop this test suite, see [Framework Tests](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces5/blob/master/TESTS.md) document.

<h3>Running Smoke Tests</h3>

In order to effectively test the project with each code modification, you need to run at least framework's smoke tests:

    $ mvn clean install -Dintegration=jbossas71 -Dsmoke

This will run the project tests against managed instance of JBoss AS 7.1 and test it on headless PhantomJS browser.

This step is also executed in [the continuous integration job](https://travis-ci.org/richfaces/richfaces/builds).
