Getting Started
---------------

In order to start with the project, you need just include the RichFaces JARs on the classpath using Maven dependency

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.richfaces</groupId>
        <artifactId>richfaces</artifactId>
        <version>4.5.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

or download the project ZIP distribution from [Downloads Page](http://www.jboss.org/richfaces/download.html).

Once you have the RichFaces JARs on the classpath, you can start developing by adding JSF page which includes RichFaces taglib from `http://richfaces.org` namespace:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en"
		xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
		...
		xmlns:rich="http://richfaces.org/rich">
		xmlns:a4j="http://richfaces.org/a4j">

	</html>

For more information on how to get started with the project, see [Project Documentation](http://docs.jboss.org/richfaces/).

Cloning the Project
-------------------

    $ git clone git@github.com:richfaces/richfaces.git

Building the Project
--------------------

Prerequsities:

* JDK 1.6 +
* Maven 3.0.4 +
* [JBoss Maven Repository](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers)

Building the project:

    $ mvn clean install

Maven will build the project and execute unit tests, but it won't build distribution or execute integration tests.

<h3>Building Project Distribution</h3>

    $ mvn clean install -Prelease

the ZIP distribution will be stored in `dist/target/`.

[Contributor Getting Started](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
-----------------------------

Read [How to Contribute](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Developing the Project
----------------------

<h3>How to Explore the Sources</h3>

All the sources related to RichFaces framework and component library are located in `core` and `components` folders:

* `src/main/java`
  * framework sources
  * JSF components under `org.richfaces.components` package
* `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources`
  * JavaScript and CSS resources

Examples such as *RichFaces Showcase* and *Components Demo* are stored in `examples` folder.

<h3>Developing the Project in IDE</h3>

Once you have [built the project](#building-the-project) you can import `core`, `components` and one of the `examples` to the IDE.

If you are using Eclipse, you should use `Import Existing Maven Project` option.

<h3>How to Test the Project</h3>

RichFaces has extensive framework test suite which validates compatibility with various browsers and application servers.

For more information on how to run and develop this test suite, see [Framework Tests](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces5/blob/master/TESTS.md) document.

<h3>Running Smoke Tests</h3>

In order to effectively test the project with each code modification, you need to run at least framework's smoke tests:

    $ mvn clean install -Dintegration=wildfly80 -Dsmoke

This will run the project tests against managed instance of WildFly 8.0 and test it on headless PhantomJS browser.

This step is also executed in [the continuous integration job](https://travis-ci.org/richfaces/richfaces/builds).
