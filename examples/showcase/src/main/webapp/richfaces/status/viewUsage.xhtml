    <p>
        The <b>r:status</b> component is an indicator of an Ajax request. It has two states: <i>start</i> and <i>stop</i>. The
        <i>start</i> state indicates that an Ajax request is in progress. When an Ajax Response is returned, the component
        switches to the <i>stop</i> state.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>r:status</b> component could be defined as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>As the default for a view.</li>
        <li>As the default for a form.</li>
        <li>Referenced explicity from the component sending the request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This example shows a view-scoped <b>r:status</b> component. It should be defined outside of any forms, and will handle
        all the Ajax requests within the view.
