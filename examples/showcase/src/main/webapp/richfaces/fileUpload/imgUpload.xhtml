        The <b>r:fileUpload</b> component allows you to upload files from the users machine to the server with various
        options.
    </p>

    <p>
        This example allows you to upload files to the demo server. The number of files allowed at once is managed with the <b>maxFilesQuantity</b>
        attribute. Every uploaded file will be processed with a <b>fileUploadListener</b> which is called after every single
        file upload operation is finished.
    </p>

        <legend>

        the maximum size of each file must not exceed 100kB
