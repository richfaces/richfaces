	<p>That sample shows the <b>r:extenedDataTable</b> sorting
	example. Actually if you will just look into the code you will see that
	it's completely similar to <b>r:dataTable</b> one because both
	tables follows completely the same rules for sorting definition.</p>
	<p>Besides that demo shows addition of sorting icons (manual for
	now) and switching between multiple and single sorting.</p>

	<p>Multiple selection in that sample follows very simple rules.
	Next column added to sorting just clarifies sorting criteria. If you
	need some other column to become main sorting property - reset sorting
	from the beginning.</p>
