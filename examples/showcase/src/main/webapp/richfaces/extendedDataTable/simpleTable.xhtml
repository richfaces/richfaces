        The <b>r:extendedDataTable</b> component provides the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horizontal and vertical scrolling</li>
        <li>Ajax lazy loading for vertical scrolling</li>
        <li>"Frozen" columns which are not scrolled with a horizontal scroll</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The component does not require the use of a special model; it supports all the standard models supported by the <b>r:dataTable</b>
        component.
    </p>
    <p>In order to turn on Ajax loading - you should just specify <b>clientRows</b> attribute with number of rows to be loaded on the client.
    In the sample below it's set to 15 or to 0 according to checkbox value. 0 value means load all the rows
    (or attribute could be just not defined at all).</p>
