        The <b>r:jQuery</b> component integrates the jQuery JavaScript library into your applications. This allows
        one to dynamically apply style and behavior to DOM elements as the result of JSF component rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>selector</b> attribute defines an object (or list of objects) against which the <b>query</b> attribute will
        be applied. The <b>query</b> attribute should be defined with valid JavaScript statements or jQuery api calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        The jQuery javascript is also accessible via EL using the <h:outputLink value="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/richfaces/component-sample.jsf?demo=functions&amp;skin=#{skinBean.skin}"><b>r:jQuery EL function</b></h:outputLink>.
    </p>

    <p>r:jQuery can be used in these modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a one time query applied immediately or on a document ready event.</li>
        <li>Define an event handler which is bound to elements returned by selector on some event.</li>
        <li>As a JavaScript function that can be invoked from custom JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example shows how to attach events to the mouseover/mouseout event on the DOM objects. The source below will
        show how to make them enlarged.</p>
    <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    <ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
        <ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
        <ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
        <ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
    </ui:include>
