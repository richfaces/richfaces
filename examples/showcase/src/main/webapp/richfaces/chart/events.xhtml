        The <b>rich:chart</b> allows to handle events using javascript handlers
        or server-side listener.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see this in action, mouseover the line chart below until you find a data point (eg. USA [1994, 20]) then
        click on that datapoint.  An event listener will update the page with details of the data point clicked.
