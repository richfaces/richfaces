        <li>allows to define different "failed" markers before the text labels</li>
        <li>has a predefined css class names for different kinds of message severities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The message marker is defined with a facet. There are several facets names available to design the marker for
        different kind of message severities. The following example shows how the markers might be used to mark the "passed" and
