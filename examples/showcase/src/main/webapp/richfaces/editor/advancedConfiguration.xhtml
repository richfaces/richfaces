        <b>rich:editor</b> has several configuration options exposed as attributes, but CKEditor implementation which RichFaces
        uses under the hood, is much more advanced than that.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to expose all <b>advanced configurations</b>, there is <b>config facet</b> (or equivalent <b>config attribute</b>)
        which enables to setup practically any setup which is possible with CKEditor.
    </p>

    <p>For example, you can configure <b>custom toolbar setup, load extra plugins, load custom stylesheet in editor's area</b>,
        etc.</p>

    <p>Both of the configuration ways (facet or config) are able to interpolate <b>EL expressions</b>, which enables you to make
        the editor <b>configuration dynamic</b>.</p>

    <p>
        To explore all <b>configuration options</b>, you may want to visit <a
            href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_configuration">CKEditor Developer Guide</a>
        and use <a href="http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html">CKEditor.config JavaScript API</a>
        as reference.
    </p>

    <p>In following sample, you can dynamically <b>change the language of editor</b>. Editor is also configured to <b>grab focus after
        page load</b> and has <b>customized toolbar setup</b>.</p>

    <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    <ui:include src="/templates/includes/source-view.xhtml">
        <ui:param name="src" value="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
        <ui:param name="sourceType" value="xhtml" />
        <ui:param name="openLabel" value="View Source" />
        <ui:param name="hideLabel" value="Hide Source" />
    </ui:include>
