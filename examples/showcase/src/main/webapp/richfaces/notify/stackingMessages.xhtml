        To influence how messages are positioned and stacked on the page, you need to define <b>r:notifyStack</b>.
    </p>

        Notify Stack component has following attributes (defaults flagged with *):
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>position</b> - the position on the page - bottomRight*, bottomLeft, topRight, topLeft</li>
        <li><b>method</b> - the stacking method defining if new messages will be placed on top (resp. bottom) of stack - last*, first</li>
        <li><b>direction</b> - the direction in which will be messages placed - vertical*, horizontal</li>
    </ul>
