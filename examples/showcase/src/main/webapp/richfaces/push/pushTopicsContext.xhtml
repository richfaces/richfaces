        Push can be controlled by a <b>programmatic API</b>. However a durable topic still needs to be created and registered in
        both RichFaces and the Java Messaging Service.
    </p>


    <r:panel>
        <ui:include src="#{demoNavigator.sampleIncludeURI}" />
    </r:panel>

    <p>
        The programmatic API consists of a <b><tt>TopicKey</tt> </b> which addresses the topic, and a <b><tt>TopicsContext</tt>
        </b> which is used for publishing messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the purpose of observing events from the server, the client creates a <b>permanent connection</b> to the server either by using a
        <i>WebSocket connection</i> or the <i>long-polling method</i>. Permanent connections are managed by the <i>Atmosphere
            Framework</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this example, the message doesn't contain any data - it <b>instructs the client to re-render part of the page</b>.  In this
        case it forces the client to load new unique ID.
    </p>
