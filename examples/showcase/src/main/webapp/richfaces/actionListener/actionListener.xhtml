        Use <b>r:actionListener</b> to register an ActionListener class on a parent action component.  Multiple
        listener methods can be registered on an action components in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>r:actionListener</b> tag differs from the standard JSF tag in that it allows the listener to be
        attached in any of three ways:
        <ol>
            <li>By listener method, using the <em>listener</em> attribute.</li>
            <li>By listener class, using the <em>type</em> attribute.</li>
            <li>By object binding, using the <em>binding</em> attribute.</li>
        </ol>
