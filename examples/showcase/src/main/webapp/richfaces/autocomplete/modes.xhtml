        The <b>r:autocomplete</b> component looks like a simple input component, but has advanced options and features to
        provide suggestions to the user during input.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are four different <i>modes</i> for how it fetches suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>client</b> - preloads data to the client and makes suggestions according to the entered prefix on the client
        </li>
        <li><b>lazyClient</b> - similar to client but initial suggestions loading performed not during the page load but 
        on first component activation.</li>
        <li><b>ajax</b> - fetches the data on every input change using Ajax requests</li>
        <li><b>cachedAjax</b> - loads data via Ajax to make suggestions when the prefix length satisfies <i>minChars</i>
            attribute value. Then all the suggestions are handled at the client until the initial prefix is changed. At that
            point it will reload with the new prefix.</li>
    </ul>
