            Write your own custom rich components with built-in AJAX support

        The CDK includes a code-generation facility and a
        templating facility using a JSP-like syntax. These capabilities help
        to avoid a routine process of a component creation. The component factory
        works like a well-oiled machine allowing the creation of first-class
        rich components with built-in Ajax functionality even more easily than
        the creation of simpler components by means of the traditional coding
        approach.

        RichFaces is a library for adding rich user interface features to JSF
        applications. It extends the JSF framework to include a large
        (and growing) set of powerful rich AJAX-enabled components that come
        with extensive skins support.
