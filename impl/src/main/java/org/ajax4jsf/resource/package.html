<h1>Package for manipulate page resources ( images, scripts, styles,
    applets etc ) at Java Server Faces render Phase and at request phase of
    concrete resource.</h1>

Note: The resource framework implements the Lightweight design patter.
Therefore, the resource classes should not contain data depends of
the particular request. The data is taken from the {@link javax.context.FacesContext}
and {@link javax.component.UIComponent}, that is passed as a parameter
when html is generated.
For passing the data with URI, the {@link InternetResourceBase} class
has getDataToSave method. It is invoked when the generation is taken place.
The returned object is serialized. Then, restoreData method de-serialize it back.
The {@link InternetResourceBuilder} class controls this process.
