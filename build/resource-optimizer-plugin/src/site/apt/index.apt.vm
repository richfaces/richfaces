${projectName}

  The ${projectName} is used during <<<process-classes>>> phase to extract
  defined component resources (defined by JSF <<<@ResourceDependency>>> annotation) and pre-render them.
  
  The ${projectName} scans for all <<<@ResourceDependency>>> definitions in <<<compile>>> scope.
  
  Pre-rendered component resources does not require runtime processing which saves processing time and
  avoid some classes otherwise necessary for runtime resource generation.
  
  Additionally ${projectName} is able to pack resources into packages, one package per resource
  mime-type. This feature can be used for aggregating all application resources to one package, optimizing
  the network transfers.
  
  The ${projectName} also provides feature for minimization of JavaScript/CSS resources using YUI Compressor.
  
  The previous features can be enabled declaratively.
