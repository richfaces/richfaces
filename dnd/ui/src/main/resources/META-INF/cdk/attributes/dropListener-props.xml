        <description>
            MethodExpression representing an action listener method that will be notified after drop operation. The
            expression must evaluate to a public method that takes an DropEvent parameter, with a
            return type of void, or to a
            public method that takes no arguments with a return type of void.
            In the latter case, the method has no way of easily
            knowing where the event came from, but this can be
            useful in cases where a notification
            is needed that "some action
            happened".
